<p>Mysore served as the capital city of Kingdom of Mysore for nearly six centuries, from 1399 until 1947. The Kingdom was ruled by the Wodeyar dynasty,
    except for a brief period in the late 18th century when Hyder Ali and Tipu Sultan were in power. Patrons of art and culture, the Wodeyars contributed
    significantly to the cultural growth of the city. The cultural ambiance and achievements of Mysore earned it the sobriquet Cultural capital of
    Karnataka.</p>
