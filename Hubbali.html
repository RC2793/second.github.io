<p>&nbsp;  &nbsp;    &nbsp;  &nbsp;   For a commercial and business hub, Hubli's name translates into sheer poetry. Hubli comes from 'Hubbali' which means flowering creeper,
    and from literature to industry, much has blossomed forth from this city. Hubli shares much of its spotlight with Dharward, its twin city. An upcoming
    industrial centre, Hubli enjoys the benefits of having been strategically located. Positioned exactly in between the Deccan Plateau and the forested
    hills of the Malenadu region, Hubli's ideal locale is further whetted by Dharwad's clout as a seat of learning. As much as it's poised to take on a
    more significant role in the commercial world, Hubli's proximity to some of Karnataka's most scenic and wild neighbourhoods, makes it what you would
    'call idyllic. The Sakrebyle Elephant Camp is one such stop. A remnant of the Chalukyan times itself, Hubli stands just a few hours away from
    Karnataka's timeless niches - Hampi, Pattadakal, Bijapur, Aihole, Bidar
    and Badami. Don't forget to taste the famous Dharward peda or pick up some fabric embellished intricately by Hubli's signature Kasuti style of embroidery.
