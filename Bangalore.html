<p>&nbsp;  &nbsp;    South India's most alive city is Bangalore. A melting point of ethnic and cultural backgrounds, the hoi polloi is charmingly
    mixed here. Nearly every one speaks English, even if it’s only a smattering, and everyone is aware of the privilege they're bestowed with. Yes, every
    resident of Bangalore, regardless of where they're from, takes immense
    pride in their address. Malls, parks, pubs, theatre, cafes, art galleries, palaces - at any given point, Bangalore is buzzing and alive with activity. A bustling city today, Bangalore often reminisces about its days as a sleepy cantonment area of the British - tree lined avenues with quaint sounding names like Richmond Town and Victoria Layout hint that the city does get sentimental about its past. The Bangalore Palace, the Attara Kacheri (High Court), St. Mary’s Basilica, Tipu’s Palace, ISKCON Temple and the Bull Temple highlight Bangalore’s many personalities and are monuments that mark its journey, ante-IT.
    Now Bangalore is known for its thriving industry and as an IT hotbed. Lonely Planet rating the city as the No.3 destination in the Best Travel
    Cities in 2012 has made Bangalore an overnight star, if it wasn’t already. Almost at the heart of South India, this cosmopolitan city is everything
    a world city needs to be. Pleasant weather, pleasant people, pleasant hangouts. And for its people, being ‘Bangalored’ has a rather affectionate
    tone to it.</p>
